# Ion Channel

Radically-Inclusive Jean Technology


Ion Channel, or ionch, for short, is an open-source federated microblogging server. By default
it's configured for a single user or a few users to run a private instance out-of-the-box, but
due to its modular nature it can support a wide range of backends, federation models, and
instance-specific features and quirks.


The ActivityPub module (Ivory) lets ionch talk to Mastodon, Pleroma, and many other existing
servers on the fediverse. So you can think of ionch as an AP or mastodon-compatible server.


## Social Pillars

### Safety and Respect

There are ways to structure social media which are inherently unsafe or disrespectful:
automated systems which are vulnerable to astroturfing and abuse-report abuse, pinning
personally-identifying information on users or forcing them to use their legal names, etc.


Any suggestion or PR that puts users at risk or denies someone their dignity or identity will be
rejected.


### Inclusion and Approachability

Without diverse voices like Lovelace and Turing, we would not have computers as we know them.
Without people like Mary Jackson or Margaret Hamilton we wouldn't have made it to the moon.
Social media might not be as groundbreaking as all that, but it has hard problems that no one
person, nor any one kind of person, can solve. We'll need a bigger boat.


At every step, from ionch governance, to code, to distribution, to instance administration, to
post moderation, to bug reporting and feature requests, we want to lower the bar to entry and
give everyone's voice a chance to be heard.


### FOSS, Openness

Not all open-source software is developed in the open. Some software just gets source pushes
for point releases, accepts no PRs, and gives very little insight into how it was developed or
the reasons behind its design choices.


The public repository for ionch is where it is developed. We welcome PRs, talk a lot about the
development process right in the fediverse where it matters, and thrive on user and developer
feedback.
